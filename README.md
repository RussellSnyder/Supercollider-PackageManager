# Supercollider-PackageManager (WIP)
auto load quarks, synthdefs and audio files from a manifest file

## Get involved!

If you want to get involved, please do! We are looking for contributions of all kinds :-)

If you want to meet IRL come by an event of [Berlin Supercollider Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Supercollider-Hack-Learn-and-Play/)

## General Idea

A common issue when moving a supercollider project from one machine to another is that quarks, audiofiles and
non-core synthdefs must be reinstalled on the new machine by hand

This package allows users declare and load dependencies using an external manifest (json file or yaml)

## Tentative plan

- [ ] Find other contributors
- [ ] Establish all non-core data needed for typical SC performance
- [ ] Establish way to declare needed data (package.json or docker dependencies for example)
- [ ] Establish way to pull in needed data (synthdefs and/or audio files)
- [ ] Prototype with SC users
- [ ] Deploy to more reachable supercollider website
- [ ] Profit?
